One of the draws of being a software engineer is the perception that you can sit in a dark room for hours and write code without talking to anyone. This sterotype is what drew me to the field because I am an introvert who had trouble speaking up. 

As I learned new programming languages, software architecture paradigm, and tools I thought I would rise to the top of my career organically. My false reality was disrupted one day a few years into my career when I had a more senior engineer say to me, "You know how to code but something is missing ... I just am not sure. You just don't got "it"". I was deeply offended of course but knew he was right. There was something missing but I just couldn't put my finger on it. 

More recently, I had a manager tell me in a 1:1 what that missing piece was. She had observed me for a few months and how I interacted with my team. From her analysis, I was not communicating effectively. 

<b>What was wrong? </b>

- I was spamming various chat channels frequently
- I was sending long messages that took too much time and effort to read
- I was quiet in meetings
- I was not practicing active listening
- I was constantly suggesting new ideas for process changes
- I was not adapting to understand the etiquette of the virtual workplace

<b>Why was this wrong?</b>

- I was distracting the team with the frequent chat messages and also sending messages to the wrong channel.
- My messages were detailed but because they were so long my recipient didn't have time to read them.
- I was multitasking during meetings so I would not participate and missed key information discussed.
- I was sharing ideas before they were well thought out. 

<b>Solution</b>

I decided to take the initative to solve this issue by honing my rusty communincation skills. I signed up for some classes to learn how to communicate effectively at the local university. I also took some classes online. 

<b>Key Takeaways</b>
- Understand your auidence and cater your communiction to them. For instance, if your audience loves using emojis and memes to communicate then don't be afraid to do the same to connenct. 
- Find a private place to store and refine your ideas. Once those ideas are more well thought out you can share them out with your team for gaining buy-in. 
- Be mindful of other's time. If it is before or after work hours when you send a message don't be surprised if it is ignored. Also, if someone is very busy they will not have time to read long messages, so keep it short and sweet.
