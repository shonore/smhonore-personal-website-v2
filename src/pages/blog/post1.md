One of the draws of being a software engineer is the perception that you can sit in a dark room for hours and write code without talking to anyone. This sterotype is what drew me to the field because I am an introvert who had trouble speaking up. 

As I learned new programming languages, software architecture paradigm, and tools I thought I would rise to the top of my career organically. It finally dawned on me. As the world shifted to virtual work I had not adapted and upskilled my communication soft skills. 

<b>What was wrong?</b>

- I was distracting the team with the frequent chat messages and also sending messages to the wrong media.
- I was multitasking during meetings and would missed key information discussed.
- I was sharing ideas before they were well thought out. 

<b>How I </b>

I decided to take the initative to solve this issue by honing my rusty communincation skills. I signed up for a class to learn how to communicate effectively at the local university, UT Austin ðŸ¤˜. I also took free online micro-learnings through my company's learning portal and took online courses at Coursera and Udemy. 

<b>Media-richness index</b>

The best piece of information I found for effective communication was the media-richness index. I wish someone had shown me this chart sooner!

In order to decipher what communication media you should use you have to consider the complexity of the task you are trying to achieve and how much information you are trying to convey. From the diagram you can see that the more complex and information rich your messages is the more synchronous your communication becomes. You would leverage asychronous communication for less information rich and complex tasks.

<b>Overcommunication</b>

Another really great tip I learned was to be aware of when its appropriate to overcommunicate information. Overcommunication is when you share more information than necessary about a topic and share it more frequently. When I am really passionate about a topic I love researching it extensively and then sharing in detail what I learn with others. Although this might be okay during your personal time it could be detrimental to you and your team if you do this at work. 

In the workplace, if you overcommunicate an issue your team might start to tune you out as the frequency of the messages increase. Also, those not interested in the topic might get bored eventually and stop paying attention. Also, it could come off as condecending. 

 There are some benefits of overcommunication. For instance, it will ensure that everyone understands the message, goals, and desired outcome while mimizing surprises.
